# some-ai-stuff

hi! i thought this was the easiest way to do this

in this repo there should be some of my old notes that introduce ai/llms/neural networks bc idk how much you know. i ran into some ip issues w the taylor swift chatbot i was gonna share but its fine! i shared one of my capstones which is a chatbot for non-verbal communicators -- not my best work but it's something

i made a super simple dnd chatbot for you. it's bare bones and might not be your vibe but i wanted to offer something

anywho, lmk if you have any issues or questions
