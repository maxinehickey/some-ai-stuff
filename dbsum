Key Points Discussed

Finalizing Requirements for Pilot

The team is working on finalizing the requirements to prepare for the pilot phase, aiming to lock them in during this meeting.

Due to time constraints, necessary changes must be made quickly before the pilot launch.

Reviewing Different Design Approaches

Three different design implementations were reviewed:

Max’s version

Akshay’s version in React

Another alternative approach

The team will decide on the best design direction and possibly conduct another experiment.

Mockups & Static Website Presentation

A team member presented mockups (created without code) and an early version of a static website to showcase the UI improvements.

Key UI enhancements include:

Light and dark mode options

Cleaner layout

Easier test reruns

Collapsible navigation bar for better screen real estate

Improved test scheduling and history view

Placeholder for test trend graphs once real data is available

Enhancing Developer Usability

The UI should be intuitive not just for performance engineers but also for developers.

Consider implementing a toggle for "Performance Engineer Mode" vs. "Developer Mode" to cater to different user needs.

A brief introduction or welcome message should be added to the homepage to explain the tool’s purpose.

Contextual help files should be included on different pages (e.g., test management) to assist new users.

Improving UI Clarity

Certain elements (e.g., text at the top) should be made larger for better visibility.

Consider adding tooltips that show descriptions when hovering over icons.

Dashboard Overview

The landing page should provide:

Total tests executed, success/failure rates.

Time and effort saved via automation.

Quick actions (start a test, view scheduled tests, configure tests).

System health status (e.g., execution engine, reporting service).

Recent activity log.

Users should be able to configure tests from multiple access points.

Test Execution & Management

Users can select test parameters, devices, browsers, and additional configurations.

Options to schedule tests (daily, weekly, etc.).

Notifications (email, Teams, Confluence updates).

Once a test is started:

Logs will generate in real-time.

Active tests will be displayed in the "Currently Running" section.

Reports & Analysis

Reports should include:

Pass/fail rates, execution details, test duration.

Graphical representation of test trends.

Exportable reports (CSV, PDF).

Future MVP iterations:

Filters for report history (last 7 days, 30 days, etc.).

Integration with NeoLoad Copilot for automated insights and recommendations.

Technical Feasibility & Development Impact

No major backend changes required for UI integration.

Estimated timeline: 1–2 sprints for full integration.

Decision on UI theme should not significantly impact the development roadmap.

Next Steps

Finalize the design approach based on feedback.

Implement UI improvements, including tooltips, introduction text, and help files.

Continue refining the static website and preparing for the pilot launch.

Maintain a focus on user-friendliness while ensuring depth for performance engineers
