#### **Overview of Alerts in Splunk**  
- Alerts help monitor machine data in real-time to detect issues, errors, or attacks.  
- Example: Detecting high failed login attempts on a web server.  

#### **Creating an Alert**  
1. Run a search for relevant events (e.g., "failed" and "password" in security logs).  
2. Click **"Save As" â†’ "Alert"** and provide a title & optional description.  
3. Set permissions (private or shared with other users).  

#### **Alert Scheduling Options**  
- **Scheduled Alerts**: Run on a defined schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) and trigger when search results meet specified criteria.  
- **Real-time Alerts**: Continuously run in the background and trigger immediately when conditions are met (can strain resources).  
- **Custom Scheduling**: Uses cron syntax to define specific times.  

#### **Trigger Conditions**  
- Alerts can be triggered based on:  
  - **Number of search results**  
  - **Number of hosts or sources**  
  - **Custom conditions**  
- Example: Trigger alert when failed password attempts are **greater than 25**.  

#### **Managing Alert Notifications**  
- Default expiration: 24 hours (can be customized).  
- **Throttle Option**: Prevents excessive alerts by suppressing them for a set time.  
  - Example: Suppress for **30 minutes** to avoid alert spam.  

#### **Alert Actions**  
When an alert is triggered, actions can include:  
- **Adding to triggered alerts list**  
- **Logging an event to a Splunk receiver**  
- **Outputting results to a lookup file**  
- **Sending an email or mobile notification**  
- **Executing a script**  
- **Using a webhook for external notifications**  
- Admins can install/custom alert actions via "Manage Actions".  

#### **Permissions & Visibility**  
- Admins can set read/write permissions by **user role, app, or all apps**.  
- Alerts can be shared across **all apps** or restricted to specific users.  

#### **Viewing & Managing Alerts**  
- Navigate to **"Triggered Alerts"** under the **Activity menu** to see active alerts.  
- Alerts can be filtered by **app, owner, severity, or title**.  
- Manage alerts via:  
  - **Searches, Reports & Alerts** in **Settings**  
  - **Alerts tab in the respective app**  
- Options include **editing, disabling, cloning, or deleting alerts**.  

#### **Example: Real-time Alert for Server Errors**  
- **Search for HTTP 500 errors** in logs.  
- Set alert type to **Real-time**.  
- **Throttle results** to avoid spam (e.g., suppress for 30 mins).  
- **Set severity to High** and **add to triggered alerts**.  
- View results in **"Triggered Alerts"** under Activity.
